# Dino (In Progress)

I tried using Deep NN TensorFlow, Basic Q-Learning, Basic SARSA, Deep NN PyTorch and have given up working on it at the moment! (mostly cuz I can't figure this out) <br />
My Initial Human controlled Dino game works tho! <br />
If you can figure out what I am doing wrong, feel free to drop a PR or a suggestion!
